🏃‍♂️ FitViz: Fitness Tracker Data Visualization using Flourish AI
📖 Overview

FitViz is a data visualization project that analyzes and visualizes fitness-related data such as steps, calories burned, heart rate, and activity duration.
Using Flourish AI, the project transforms raw fitness data into interactive and insightful visual representations that help identify activity trends and user performance patterns.

This project demonstrates how data visualization tools can convert complex datasets into clear, meaningful insights — especially useful for fitness tracking, health analytics, and decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze the Fitness Tracker Dataset and identify meaningful insights.

To create interactive and visually appealing dashboards using Flourish AI.

To demonstrate the use of data visualization tools in real-world health analytics applications.

To improve understanding of user activity, performance, and wellness patterns.

🧩 Dataset Description

The Fitness Tracker Dataset contains user-specific daily activity information such as:

👣 Steps Count

🔥 Calories Burned

❤️ Heart Rate

⏱️ Active Minutes

💤 Sleep Duration

The dataset was cleaned, prepared, and uploaded to Flourish AI for further visualization and exploration.
